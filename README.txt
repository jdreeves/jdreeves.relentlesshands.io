A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/markteater/pen/xbNyOJ.

 Apple has been creating some amazing scrolling video sites lately and I've been trying to create a simplified plugin to recreate this effect. This is the alpha version of this plugin. You can see an example of the effect I'm recreating here: http://www.apple.com/macbook/

This uses requestAnimationFrame and allows you to create multiple custom scrolling videos easily.
